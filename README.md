## **Project Overview**

Bazaan is a decentralized social shopping network that empowers users to create and manage their own online shops. Leveraging the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain, Bazaan emphasizes privacy, autonomy, and local commerce. Users can tailor their shops and channels to their country, fostering local business connections and community support.

### **Challenges Addressed**

The global crisis has highlighted vulnerabilities in the supply chain, particularly within the essential goods sector. Dominated by a few large corporations, small local farmers and businesses often struggle to compete. The technical and logistical barriers to establishing an online presence compound these challenges, limiting their market reach and growth potential.

### **Our Solution**

Bazaan bridges this gap by offering a straightforward platform for local businesses to create online shops, lend equipment, and offer services. This initiative not only provides an additional revenue stream but also enhances food sovereignty and community resilience through decentralized trade and communication.
